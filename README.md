Machine Learning Challenges
===========================

## This repository houses a collection of weekly challenges designed to
## improve Python skills in data wrangling, modeling, and visualization. The
## directories for the respective challenges contain source code primarily in
## the form of data preprocessing scripts, machine learning models,
## interactive visualizations made using D3.js, and, in many cases, Jupyter
## Notebooks providing a walkthrough of the challenge's work flow. Although
## I'm primarily considering this to be a subsection of my coding portfolio, I
## intend to curate this work for other's learning and reference.
